      <strong className="mt-10">Why Convert PDF to TIFF?</strong>
      <p className="mt-2">
        PDF (Portable Document Format) is a widely used format for sharing and
        archiving documents, combining text, images, and graphics in a single
        file. However, converting PDFs to TIFF (Tagged Image File Format) images
        can be advantageous, especially for purposes such as printing,
        professional graphics, and archival storage. TIFFs are known for their
        high quality and are widely supported across various professional
        applications, making them ideal for use in environments where image
        fidelity is paramount.
